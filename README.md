# Pocket-Healer
A game where you need to keep your friends alive to defeat your enemies.

Pocket Healer is a game where your goal is to defeat boss monsters by supporting a team of adventurers, mainly by preventing them from dying. It is heavily inspired by playing healer/support roles in massively multiplayer games (particularly, but not limited to, World of Warcraft). While the desired scope is fairly less grand than the average MMORPG, there's a distinct advantage in not needing to herd a large team of cats in order to enjoy it.

Special thanks to Dmitry Volevdoz, whose game Little Healer features a similar premise and inspired this game. Little Healer is available on the Android app store.
